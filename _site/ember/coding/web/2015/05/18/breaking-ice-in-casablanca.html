    <h3>Just some idea</h3>

<p>Three weeks ago I decided to visit Casablanca to meet my fellow coders. Besides this I also wanted to continue a small tradition I had introduced last year. Casablanca.rb, it is (one) the first meetup organized of its kind. At that time I had announced it long before the actual meetup would have taken place. So in the end the RSVP count dropped down from 30 to 15 attenders. Nevertheless it was a nice experience and I encouraged them to frequently organize a meetup in order the community could grow.</p>

<h3>Not only about ruby</h3>

<p>Despite the fact Casablanca.rb was initiated for the sake of connecting ruby developers. This time I wanted something concrete and also connect with students. So I asked my friend Zakaria Braksa about the possibilities to host an event at the university where he is studying at the time of writing.
I did want to have a concrete event and something students knew about. So it became a workshop-style meetup which was about &quot;Creating a whatsapp service in one day&quot;, yeah we almost did it :)</p>

<p><img src="/images/casa_1.jpeg" alt="Me"></p>

<p>The goal wasn&#39;t about finishing the project nor about creating another service. But about bringing students and professionals together in one place. It was about breaking the ice and learning together.</p>

<h3>The preparation</h3>

<p>As the date move closer, I had to prepare this workshop. To prepare this workshop I needed to have some working code as some kind of ultimate example. Which turn out hard to do so, because where should I stop with specs for this tiny or huge thing. :)</p>

<p>While building the app I prepared the written version of the workshop. It is not available, because it wasn&#39;t created for this purpose.</p>

<p><img src="/images/casa_2.jpeg" alt="Community"></p>

<p>Also because Ember-CLI was the main stack, I was looking for someone to get us the Ember-CLI 101 book by Adolfo Builes, in the end writer Adolfo Builes, was kind enough to sponsor us the Ember-CLI 101 book which himself. We were limited to an amount of books so I only sent the books to attenders who did promise me two things, they would attend the meeting / and do their best to read the book before the meetup would start. And some of them actually did this which is totally awesome.</p>

<h3>Around 30 attenders</h3>

<p>It was great to see how the class filling up with fellow coders interested in this workshop. Supinfo Casablanca which made this class-room available really did take care of us and helped in any way possible. As well as the people around me, from the community and people I never even met.</p>

<h3>Community</h3>

<p>If you are a Ruby / Rails / Django / Ember.js ... or what whatever fits in this developer. Just make sure if you are in Casablanca to meet the community, attend or propose a meetup. The people are really nice and a hidden beauty the city of Casablanca.</p>
